Parse Tweets into Components**\n","\n","Your class assignment this semester had you manually clean tweets to reinforce your understanding of Python, RegEx and NLP using tweets. For the final class project, I encourage you to use text preprocessing libraries like 'preprocessor' illustrated below so you can focus on analysis and interpretation.\n","\n","Unfortunately, the 'preprocessor' library is relatively new and has no written documentation as of Nov 2020 (see: https://preprocessor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). By experimenting and looking at code reversed engineering the key functionality you may want to use in the code blocks below.\n","\n","References:\n","\n","* https://github.com/s/preprocessor\n","* https://towardsdatascience.com/basic-tweet-preprocessing-in-python-efd8360d529e "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WiriwdyJ7210"},"source":["## Python Library to clean tweets: preprocessor\n","\n","Cleans tweets, customizable filters \n","* Input: string\n","* Output: string\n","\n","Ref: https://github.com/s/preprocessor\n","\n","```\n","p.set_options(p.OPT.URL, p.OPT.EMOJI)\n","p.clean('Preprocessor is #awesome 👍 https://github.com/s/preprocessor')\n","'Preprocessor is #awesome'\n","```\n","\n","Options are:\n","```\n","Option Name\tOption Short Code\n","URL\tp.OPT.URL\n","Mention\tp.OPT.MENTION\n","Hashtag\tp.OPT.HASHTAG\n","Reserved Words\tp.OPT.RESERVED\n","Emoji\tp.OPT.EMOJI\n","Smiley\tp.OPT.SMILEY\n","Number\tp.OPT.NUMBER\n","```\n","\n","The next few code blocks will show you how the library 'preprocessor' can clean, parse and tokenize tweets\n","\n","* More info at: https://github.com/s/preprocessor"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AEMjjbHYrnpS","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1607178124824,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2994,"user":{"displayName":"Jon Chun","photoUrl":"","userId":"14430240466678867548"}},"outputId":"2dcc9539-e97b-4992-f9b2-27ced74dc4cf"},"source":["!pip install tweet-preprocessor"],"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting tweet-preprocessor\n","  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/17/9d/71bd016a9edcef8860c607e531f30bd09b13103c7951ae73dd2bf174163c/tweet_preprocessor-0.6.0-py3-none-any.whl\n","Installing collected packages: tweet-preprocessor\n","Successfully installed tweet-preprocessor-0.6.0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qpvJQdTfsLJ2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1607178124825,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1919,"user":{"displayName":"Jon Chun","photoUrl":"","userId":"14430240466678867548"}}},"source":["import preprocessor as p"],"execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"lm2s29Xpv8Dd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1607178125668,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":438,"user":{"displayName":"Jon Chun","photoUrl":"","userId":"14430240466678867548"}}},"source":["#install tweet-preprocessor to clean tweets\n","# https://towardsdatascience.com/twitter-sentiment-analysis-nlp-text-analytics-b7b296d71fce\n","# https://github.com/importdata/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_Support_Vector_Classifier.ipynb\n","\n","#set up punctuations we want to be replaced\n","REPLACE_NO_SPACE = re.compile(\"(\\.)|(\\;)|(\\:)|(\\!)|(\\')|(\\?)|(\\,)|(\\\")|(\\|)|(\\()|(\\))|(\\[)|(\\])|(\\%)|(\\$)|(\\>)|(\\<)|(\\{)|(\\})\")\n","REPLACE_WITH_SPACE = re.compile(\"(<br\\s/><br\\s/?)|(-)|(/)|(:).\")\n","\n","def tweet_nopunct(astr):\n","  \"\"\"input string is cleaned of punctuation and markup tags\"\"\"\n","  astr_clean = p.clean(astr)\n","  #remove puctuation\n","  astr_clean = REPLACE_NO_SPACE.sub(\"\", astr_clean.lower()) #
