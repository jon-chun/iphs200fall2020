Shapefiles are vector format files about geographic coordinates or polygons that are stored in a compressed zip file. Vector formats store information about graphics as mathematical formulas, rather than pixels, which makes the files small and portable. About 2127 entries on [LA Counts](http://lacounts.org/) feature shapefiles, making it one of the more popular formats. When you use shapefiles, Mapbox converts the data from the compressed zip file to vector tiles. From there, you can create styles using this geographic data to generate map visualizations, similar to the last Instructable, which mapped geographic coordinates. \n",
